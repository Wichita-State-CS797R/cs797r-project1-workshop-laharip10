# Step 3: Performed the display of monkey finder with different money located in different places.

# Step 4:  Different features
 -
 individual page was created to the monkey user interface with more detailed infromation.
 ![step4](https://github.com/Wichita-State-CS797R/cs797r-project1-workshop-laharip10/blob/main/MonkeyFinder/3.PNG)
# step 5: introduced maps to find the location near to the user.
-introduced map with the loactions to find the 'MonkeysViewModel.cs' with new property

# step 7: APP Theme
-  an "empty view" typically refers to a concept related to the user interface (UI) development,
	- especially in the context of web applications using technologies like ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET Core MVC. 
	- An empty view typically means a view template that doesn't contain any content or data when initially rendered. It serves as a starting point for developers to build and customize the UI according to their requirements.

# step 8: Upadted Layouts

- Used linear layout and grid layout to perform the monekeys infromation in difeerent layout format.

# step 9: Related modificatoions:
- provided all the realted screenshots to the final output of the project.
- ![window](https://github.com/Wichita-State-CS797R/cs797r-project1-workshop-laharip10/blob/main/MonkeyFinder/last.PNG)
# step 10:
- Sucessfully created my .net MAUI project.
